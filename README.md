Samples for ES6 generators

For more of my samples, see [sandcastle-samples](https://github.com/sandcastle-samples).


## Getting Started

All samples are in the form of `mocha` unit tests.

Before running the tests, make sure you have all the NPM dependencies available:

```shell
npm install
```

To run the tests, use the `test` command setup in the `package.json` as this will
automatically load in the `--harmony` flags for ES6.

```shell
npm test
```

:tada:
